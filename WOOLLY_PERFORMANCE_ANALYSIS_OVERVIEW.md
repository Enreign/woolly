# Woolly Performance Analysis Overview

## Executive Summary

Woolly is a Rust-based inference engine ported from llama.cpp that currently performs **115x slower** than target (0.13 tokens/sec vs 15+ tokens/sec target). Despite having advanced optimizations implemented, fundamental architectural issues prevent achieving competitive performance. This document provides a comprehensive analysis and roadmap to achieve +50% performance over llama.cpp.

## Current State Assessment

### Performance Reality Check
- **Current Performance**: 0.13 tokens/sec (77 seconds per token)
- **Target Performance**: >15 tokens/sec
- **llama.cpp Baseline**: ~10-15 tokens/sec on similar hardware
- **Required Improvement**: 115x to match target, 150x to exceed llama.cpp by 50%

### Critical Issues Identified

1. **GGUF Dequantization Bottleneck (90% of execution time)**
   - Weights are dequantized on every layer access with no caching
   - 2,812 dequantization operations for a single token
   - Takes 90+ seconds just unpacking weights

2. **Broken SIMD Implementation**
   - SIMD code makes performance 5.3x WORSE instead of better
   - Memory allocations in hot paths
   - CPU feature detection on every operation
   - No buffer pooling or reuse

3. **Manual Attention Loops**
   - `compute_simd_gqa_attention` uses nested scalar loops instead of BLAS
   - Only 2 BLAS calls for entire inference (should be 80+ for 40 layers)
   - Critical bug in lines 841-1047 of `lazy_transformer.rs`

4. **Architectural Over-Engineering**
   - 6+ different transformer implementations causing confusion
   - Optimizations exist but aren't properly integrated
   - Mixed optimization levels throughout codebase

## Comparison with llama.cpp

### Key Advantages of llama.cpp
1. **Flash Attention** - Reduces memory bandwidth by 10x
2. **Optimized Micro-kernels** - Hand-tuned assembly for matrix operations
3. **Direct Quantized Operations** - No dequantization needed
4. **Cache-aware Blocking** - Tuned for L1/L2/L3 cache sizes
5. **Kernel Fusion** - Combined operations reduce memory traffic

### What Woolly is Missing
- No Flash Attention implementation
- Basic matrix multiplication without micro-kernels
- Forced dequantization on every operation
- Poor memory layout and cache utilization
- No kernel fusion or graph optimization

   ```bash
   export WOOLLY_DISABLE_SIMD=1
   ```

   - Cache per layer, not per operation
   - Expected: 50x reduction in dequantization overhead

### Phase 2: Core Optimizations (Week 3-4)
**Goal**: Reach competitive performance (2 → 10 tokens/sec)

1. **Implement Weight Caching System**
   ```rust
   pub struct DequantizationCache {
       cache: HashMap<TensorId, Arc<Tensor>>,
       memory_limit: usize,
       eviction_policy: EvictionPolicy,
   }
   ```

2. **Fix Memory Management**
   - Enable existing memory pool implementation
   - Pre-allocate all buffers at startup
   - Zero allocations during inference

3. **Basic Kernel Fusion**
   - Fuse Linear + Activation operations
   - Combine QKV projections
   - Fuse LayerNorm + following operation

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimizations (Week 5-6)
**Goal**: Exceed llama.cpp performance (10 → 20+ tokens/sec)

1. **Implement Flash Attention**

   - Use tiling to fit in L2 cache
   - Expected: 2-3x speedup on attention

2. **Add Optimized Micro-kernels**
   ```rust
   // Port llamafile's 8x8 micro-kernel
   #[target_feature(enable = "avx2")]
   unsafe fn gemm_microkernel_8x8_avx2(...) {
       // Optimized implementation
   }
   ```

3. **Direct Quantized Operations**
   - Implement Q4 × FP16 matrix multiplication
   - Avoid dequantization entirely
   - Expected: 2x memory bandwidth improvement

   - Rollback capability for optimizations

3. **Compatibility Issues**
   - Maintain GGUF format support
   - Test with multiple model variants

## Conclusion

Woolly has solid architectural foundations but suffers from integration issues and a critical dequantization bottleneck. By following this roadmap, we can achieve:

1. **Week 1-2**: Fix critical bugs → 2 tokens/sec (15x improvement)
2. **Week 3-4**: Core optimizations → 10 tokens/sec (75x improvement)
3. **Week 5-6**: Advanced optimizations → 20 tokens/sec (150x improvement)
4. **Week 7-8**: Platform optimizations → 30+ tokens/sec (230x improvement)

This would result in **+50-100% performance over llama.cpp**, making Woolly a leading Rust-based inference engine.

## Next Immediate Actions

1. **Emergency Fix**: Disable SIMD and implement basic weight caching
2. **Measure Baseline**: Run comprehensive benchmarks with fixes
3. **Fix Attention**: Replace manual loops with BLAS calls

5. **Daily Validation**: Run Python validator to track improvements

The path to high performance is clear - we need to fix the basics before optimizing further.
