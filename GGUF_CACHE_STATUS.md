# GGUF Dequantization Cache Implementation Status

## What We've Done

1. **Enabled the dequantization cache** that was previously disabled for debugging
   - Increased cache size to 4GB to hold all model weights
   - Enabled frequency-based prioritization
   - Set up prefetch for next layers

2. **Integrated cache into LazyTensor**
   - Modified `LazyTensor::data()` to use the global dequantization cache
   - Added logging to track cache hits and misses
   - Fixed borrowing issues in the implementation

3. **Removed cache clearing**
   - Commented out the code that was clearing tensor caches after each layer
   - This was causing repeated dequantization on every token

## Current Status

The cache is working but there's still a problem:
- First inference: All cache misses (expected) - takes ~169 seconds
- Second inference: Should have cache hits but still takes ~233 seconds

## Issue Analysis

The problem appears to be that while we have a `DequantizationCache` at the `LazyModelWeights` level, each `LazyTensor` also has its own `cached_data` field. The issue is:

1. When `get_tensor()` is called, it returns a reference `&[f32]`
2. The LazyTensor's `cached_data` is storing the dequantized data
3. But this cached_data seems to be getting cleared somehow between inferences

## Next Steps

To fully fix the GGUF dequantization bottleneck:

1. **Debug why cache isn't persisting between inferences**
   - The DequantizationCache should be holding the data
   - But something is causing re-dequantization

2. **Consider removing LazyTensor's individual cache**
   - Just use the global DequantizationCache
   - This would simplify the caching logic

3. **Add cache statistics logging**
   - Print cache hit rate after each inference
   - This will help verify if the cache is working

4. **Profile the actual dequantization time**
   - Add timing to see how much time is spent in dequantization vs other operations

## Performance Impact

Even with the current partial caching:
- With SIMD disabled: ~36 seconds per token
- With cache (but not fully working): Still slow (~169-233 seconds)
- Target: <1 second per token

The cache infrastructure is in place but needs debugging to ensure it's actually reusing dequantized weights across tokens and inferences.
