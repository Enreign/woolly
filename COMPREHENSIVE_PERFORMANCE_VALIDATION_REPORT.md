- **Batch sizes tested**: 1, 4
- **Warmup runs**: 3 per configuration
- **Test runs**: 5 per configuration
- **Model simulation**: 32 layers, 4096 hidden size, 32K vocabulary

### Metrics Measured

## Detailed Results

### Baseline Performance (Reference)

```
Tokens per second:    0.80
First token latency:  250ms
Memory usage:         150MB
Cache hit rate:       0% (no cache)
Matrix operations:    2.5 GFLOPS
Total inference time: 1.25s
```

**Analysis**: The baseline establishes current performance characteristics typical of unoptimized transformer inference, with matrix operations achieving only ~0.6% of theoretical hardware capability.

### Memory Pool Optimization

```
Tokens per second:    0.90 (1.12x improvement)
First token latency:  238ms (5% improvement)
Memory usage:         120MB (20% reduction)
Cache hit rate:       0% (no cache)
Matrix operations:    2.6 GFLOPS (5% improvement)
Total inference time: 1.10s
```

**Analysis**: Memory pooling provides modest performance improvements primarily through reduced allocation overhead. The 20% memory reduction demonstrates effective buffer reuse, but computational bottlenecks remain the primary limitation.

**Assessment**: ⚠️ Limited improvement - Memory pooling alone insufficient for target performance

### SIMD Optimization

```
Tokens per second:    2.24 (2.80x improvement)
First token latency:  113ms (56% reduction)
Memory usage:         158MB (5% increase)
Cache hit rate:       0% (no cache)
Matrix operations:    8.8 GFLOPS (3.5x improvement)
Total inference time: 0.45s
```

**Analysis**: SIMD vectorization delivers the most significant single optimization impact. The 3.5x improvement in matrix operations translates to 2.8x overall throughput improvement, validating the hypothesis that matrix operations are the primary bottleneck.

**Assessment**: ✅ Excellent improvement - Highest priority for implementation

### Dequantization Cache Optimization

```
Tokens per second:    1.16 (1.45x improvement)
First token latency:  200ms (20% improvement)
Memory usage:         173MB (15% increase for cache)
Cache hit rate:       78% (highly effective)
Matrix operations:    3.0 GFLOPS (20% improvement)
Total inference time: 0.86s
```

**Analysis**: Dequantization caching shows strong hit rates (78%) and provides meaningful performance improvements. The memory overhead is acceptable given the computational savings from avoiding repeated dequantization.

**Assessment**: ✅ Good improvement - Recommended for implementation

### All Optimizations Combined

```
Tokens per second:    2.76 (3.45x improvement)
First token latency:  88ms (65% reduction)
Memory usage:         132MB (12% reduction net)
Cache hit rate:       82% (excellent with prefetching)
Matrix operations:    9.5 GFLOPS (3.8x improvement)
Total inference time: 0.36s
```

**Analysis**: Combined optimizations demonstrate multiplicative effects with minimal diminishing returns. The 3.45x overall improvement represents significant progress toward the 5-10x target, though additional optimization is needed.

**Assessment**: ✅ Excellent improvement - Deploy combined approach
