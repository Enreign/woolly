# ðŸ“Š Woolly Performance Summary vs llama.cpp

## Current Performance Status

### Woolly Performance:
- **Without SIMD**: 0.10 tokens/sec (96.95s per token)
- **With SIMD**: 0.019 tokens/sec (50.77s per token)
- **SIMD is 5.3x SLOWER** due to memory allocation overhead

### llama.cpp (Ollama) Performance:
- **0.6-1.2 tokens/sec** on the same Granite 3.3B-8B model
- Using the same hardware (Apple M4)

### Performance Gap:
- Woolly is **31-63x slower** than llama.cpp
- Instead of the target 5-10x faster, we're 30-60x slower

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Memory Allocation Overhead**
   - SIMD functions allocate new vectors on every operation
   - Thousands of allocations per token
   - Memory pool exists but isn't used by SIMD

2. **Inefficient SIMD Implementation**
   - Runtime CPU feature detection on every call
   - Excessive data copying between formats
   - No size thresholds (SIMD used even for tiny operations)

3. **Architecture Issues**
   - GQA implementation has dimension handling bugs
   - Multiple tensor format conversions
   - Poor cache locality

## Path to Target Performance

### Immediate Fixes (2-4x improvement):
1. Use memory pool in SIMD operations
2. Cache CPU feature detection
3. Add size thresholds for SIMD

### Medium-term Optimizations (5-10x improvement):
1. Proper SIMD kernels with loop unrolling
2. Cache-blocked matrix operations
3. Fused operations to reduce memory traffic

### Long-term Goals (10-20x improvement):
1. Flash Attention implementation
2. Quantization-aware kernels
3. Model-specific optimizations

## Conclusion

While Woolly has modern architecture (SwiGLU, RMSNorm, GQA) and comprehensive optimizations, the implementation has significant overhead that makes it slower than the baseline llama.cpp. The SIMD implementation particularly needs a complete rewrite to eliminate allocation overhead and properly utilize vector instructions.

The target of 5-10x improvement over llama.cpp (3-12 tokens/sec) is achievable but requires fixing the fundamental performance issues identified, starting with memory allocation patterns and SIMD efficiency.
