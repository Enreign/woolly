# Woolly Performance Status Report

## Current Performance
- **Measured**: 0.13 tokens/sec (77 seconds for single token)
- **Target**: >15 tokens/sec  
- **Status**: ❌ 115x slower than target

## Optimizations Applied
1. ✅ Fixed GQA attention nested loops (reduced from 6 to 3 levels)
2. ✅ Eliminated memory allocations in hot paths
3. ✅ Fixed SIMD RefCell borrow errors
4. ✅ Pre-allocated attention buffers
5. ✅ Vectorized dot products

## Remaining Bottlenecks
1. **GGUF Dequantization** (90+ seconds)
   - Dequantizing on every layer access
   - No effective weight caching
   
2. **Matrix Multiplication**
   - Not using optimized BLAS
   - SIMD not properly engaged
   
3. **Memory Access**
   - Poor cache locality
   - Excessive memory copying
   
4. **Threading**
   - Single-threaded execution
   - No parallel layer processing

## Next Steps for >15 tokens/sec
1. **Implement Weight Caching**
   - Cache dequantized weights after first use
   - Estimated speedup: 10-20x
   
2. **Enable Proper SIMD**
   - Fix SIMD matrix operations
   - Use NEON on ARM effectively
   - Estimated speedup: 2-4x
   
3. **Parallel Layer Processing**
   - Process attention heads in parallel
   - Use Rayon for multi-threading
   - Estimated speedup: 2-3x
   
4. **Memory-Mapped GGUF**
   - Avoid loading entire model to RAM
   - Direct memory-mapped access
   - Estimated speedup: 1.5-2x

## Ole Desktop Integration Status
- ✅ Server running and accessible
- ✅ Models list endpoint working
- ✅ Model loading functional
- ❌ Performance too slow for practical use
- ⏳ Need >15 tokens/sec for good UX

## Conclusion
While the GQA optimization helped, the primary bottleneck appears to be GGUF dequantization happening repeatedly. Implementing proper weight caching should provide the most significant speedup to achieve the target performance.
